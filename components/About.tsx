            Latinitas Recens is a lexicon of Neo-Latin (New Latin) vocabulary compiled by a mysterious scholar named Florus, with translations in Italian and English.
            It has been preserved on the <a href='http://web.archive.org/web/20080415072407/http://users.adelphia.net/~florusc/latine/search.html'>Wayback Machine</a> and incorporated into <a href='https://latinlexicon.org/latinitas_recens_latine.php'>Numen</a> (which makes it a lot more useful), but I figured there would be no harm in my hosting it myself as well.
        </p>
        <p>
            Aside from removing line-breaks and correcting some typos, I have kept the 2217 data records as they are in Florus’ version.
            For explanations of the abbreviations in the lexicon, see the Numen link.

            I came across Latinitas Recens while compiling my own Latin lexicon, <a href='https://www.velut.co.uk' title='velut — the Latin rhyming dictionary by Duncan Ritchie'>velut</a>.
            My dictionary covers all eras of Latin (except perhaps the earliest Latin), but is very incomplete.
            I’m continuing to add to it, but slowly and with a bias towards the classical period.
        </p>
        <p>
            Latinitas Recens will remain a better resource than velut if you’re wanting a lot more New Latin words and phrases (obviously), as well as dictionary citations and Italian translations.
